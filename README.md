> [!NOTE]
> This application was developed as a personal learning project to explore and understand Rust programming concepts. While functional, it may contain bugs or unexpected behaviors. I am not responsible for missed meetings because you got too efficient, carpal tunnel from excessive app switching, or your cat learning to manipulate your windows after watching you use this tool

## How It Works

1. Press the right Command key to trigger Fast Forward.
2. You can:
   - Type to search for the app you want.
   - Use Tab to highlight the next app in the list.
4. Release the Command key to switch to the selected app.
   - To hide or close the selected app, press Space or Escape instead of releasing the Command key.
