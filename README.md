> [!NOTE]
> This application was developed as a personal learning project to explore and understand Rust programming concepts. While functional, it may contain bugs or unexpected behaviors. I am not responsible for missed meetings because you got too efficient, carpal tunnel from excessive app switching, or your cat learning to manipulate your windows after watching you use this tool

## How It Works

1. Press the right Command key to activate the window switcher
2. Either:
   - Press Tab to cycle through open windows, or
   - Start typing to fuzzy search for your desired application
3. Release to switch to the selected window
